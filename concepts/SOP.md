# The same-origin policy (SOP) 
SOP is one way in which browsers protect their users from the dynamically loaded (JavaScript) application code executing when opening a webpage. The SOP specifies that dynamic requests can only be sent to URLs with the same origin as the page they are sent from.


## Ok, so to recap…
1. The SOP is there to prevent a user (tricked into) visiting https://malicious.com from carrying out actions against https://protected-api.com .
2. CORS is there to allow https://api.github.com to be accessible from sites other than https://api.github.com itself, while still preventing the scenario above.

#####
CORS relaxes the SOP, by specifying how an API at origin B can broadcast allowing requests from other origins


Accessing cookies from other websites in your HTML or JavaScript is not possible directly due to the Same-Origin Policy (SOP) enforced by modern web browsers. This policy ensures that scripts on a webpage can only access cookies, DOM, and other resources associated with the same origin (protocol, domain, and port).
Why is this restriction in place?

    Security: Prevents malicious websites from stealing sensitive information (e.g., session cookies) from another website.
    Privacy: Safeguards users' browsing data across different websites.

Scenarios where accessing cookies might seem possible

    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): If a website is vulnerable to XSS, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the site, allowing it to steal cookies from that site.
        Solution: Websites should use HTTP headers like Content-Security-Policy and HttpOnly cookies to mitigate this risk.

    Third-Party Contexts: Cookies from other domains might be accessible in third-party contexts (e.g., embedded iframes), but only if those cookies have the SameSite=None; Secure attribute.
        Solution: Avoid exposing sensitive cookies in such scenarios.

    Server-Side Approaches: If you control the server, you can proxy requests through your server to access data or cookies from other domains.

    CORS: Properly configured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) allows limited interaction between different origins but doesn’t directly expose cookies to JavaScript.

How do malicious actors try to bypass this?

    Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks: Intercepting data in transit over unsecured connections (HTTP).
        Solution: Always use HTTPS.
    Session Hijacking: Exploiting improperly secured cookies.
        Solution: Use HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite attributes for cookies.

Legal and Ethical Considerations

Attempting to bypass these security measures is unethical and likely illegal under laws like GDPR, CCPA, or various cybersecurity statutes.

If you need to share data (like cookies) between sites you control, consider:

    Using a backend to share data securely.
    Implementing OAuth or federated authentication.
