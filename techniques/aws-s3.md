1. Identify Bucket Accessibility
    curl -I https://conveyor-production-uploaded.s3.amazonaws.com
    aws s3 ls s3://conveyor-production-uploaded --no-sign-request

2. Test for Object Accessibility
    curl -I https://conveyor-production-uploaded.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
    curl -I https://conveyor-production-uploaded.s3.amazonaws.com/README.md


3. Check for Website Configuration
    curl -I http://conveyor-production-uploaded.s3-website.amazonaws.com    //Replace the region (s3-website) with the appropriate endpoint if needed.

4. Use S3 Security Testing Tools
    s3scanner scan -b conveyor-production-uploaded
    s3scanner scan -f assault_alpha/aws-s3.txt
    AWSBucketDump:                                                          //Search for public objects in the bucket.

5. Search for Sensitive Data
    grep -ri "key" ./downloaded-files       //Download accessible files and analyze them for sensitive information (e.g., credentials, private keys, or PII).

6. DNS Enumeration
    dig conveyor-production-uploaded.s3.amazonaws.com //If the bucket is mapped to a custom domain, test the domain for security vulnerabilities.

7. Check for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
    curl -I -X OPTIONS https://conveyor-production-uploaded.s3.amazonaws.com    //Look for CORS headers in the response to understand cross-origin policies.

8. Monitor HTTP Responses
    200 OK: The bucket or object is publicly accessible.
    403 Forbidden: The bucket exists but is not public.
    404 Not Found: The bucket or object does not exist.
    
    x-amz-bucket-region: us-east-1
    x-amz-request-id: 011A1Q6B0S649PJS
    x-amz-id-2: QtaocIyvxGWylSbTs9gZnbymY654GxLmiUTj/QmWYuj4et1H4aZUVhxSewQPSjmm/Rxu53y2nSz1vEkl7rMpU2rfRc/+52gO


9. Check Subdomain Takeover
    nslookup conveyor-production-uploaded.s3.amazonaws.com  //If the bucket doesnâ€™t exist, investigate further for takeover possibilities.

10. Document Findings
    Record all results, including response codes, accessible objects, and any vulnerabilities discovered. Report findings responsibly if you identify misconfigurations.
