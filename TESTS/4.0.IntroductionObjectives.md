1. Security test: a security test is a method of evaluating the security of a computer system or network 
    by methodically validating and verifying the effectiveness of application security controls.

2. Web application security test: a web application security test focuses only on evaluating
    the security of a web application. The process involves an active analysis of the application for vulnerabilities.

3. Vulnerability: a vulnerability is a flaw or weakness in a system’s design, implementation, operation or management 
    that could be exploited to compromise the system’s security objectives.

4. Threat: a threat is anything (a malicious external attacker, an internal user, a system instability, etc) that may 
    harm the assets owned by an application (resources of value, such as the data in a database or in the file system) 
    by exploiting a vulnerability.

5. Testing model
    - Test: a test is an action to demonstrate that an application meets the security requirements of its stakeholders.
        - Passive Testing
        - Active Testing
    - Tester: Who performs the testing activities
    - Tools and methodology: The core of this Testing Guide project
    - Application: The black box to test
